            <p>Space Exploration Technologies Corporation,
               better known as SpaceX, is an American aerospace
               manufacturer and space transport services company
               headquartered in Hawthorne, California, USA.
               It was founded in 2002 by former PayPal
               entrepreneur and Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk
               with the goal of creating the technologies
               to reduce space transportation costs and
               enable the colonization of Mars.On December 21,
               2015, SpaceX successfully returned a first stage
               back to a landing pad near the launch site and
               accomplished a propulsive vertical landing.

            <p>New Horizons is an interplanetary space probe
               that was launched as a part of NASA's
               New Frontiers program.Engineered by the
               Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics
               Laboratory (APL) and the Southwest Research
               Institute (SwRI), with a team led by S. Alan
               Stern, the spacecraft was launched with
               the primary mission to perform a flyby study
               of the Pluto system, and a secondary mission
               to fly by and study one or more other Kuiper
               belt objects (KBOs).On July 14, 2015, at
               11:49 UTC, it flew 12,500 km (7,800 mi) above
               the surface of Pluto,making it the first
               spacecraft to explore the dwarf planet.
